# Project Brief: LLM Evaluation App

## Mission Statement
To provide a robust, extensible toolkit for evaluating text extraction from images using AWS Bedrock and comparing outputs, enabling accurate assessment of LLM-based OCR capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Image Processing
   - Extract text from images using AWS Bedrock LLM
   - Support common image formats (PNG, JPEG)
   - Maintain image quality during processing
   - Handle images of varying sizes and content

2. Text Comparison
   - Compare extracted text with ground truth
   - Normalize text for consistent comparison
   - Handle special characters and whitespace
   - Report exact matches accurately

3. Configuration
   - Support AWS credentials configuration
   - Allow model selection
   - Enable environment-based settings
   - Maintain secure credential handling

4. Testing
   - Unit tests for all functionality
   - Mock external services
   - Test with various image types
   - Verify error handling

### Non-Functional Requirements

   - Fast text comparison
   - Efficient image processing
   - Minimal memory usage
   - Quick test execution

2. Reliability
   - Proper error handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Clear error messages
   - Consistent results

3. Maintainability
