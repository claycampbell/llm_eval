# Active Context

## Current Focus
Successfully simplified the LLM evaluation application to a single-screen interface that maintains core functionality while reducing complexity.

## Recent Changes
1. Created simple.py with core Flask application
2. Implemented single-page HTML interface
3. Preserved essential functionality:
   - AWS Bedrock text extraction
   - Text normalization
   - Ground truth comparison
4. Added basic error handling
5. Updated documentation to reflect simplified architecture

## Key Decisions
1. **Single Screen Design**: Chose to combine all functionality into one page for simplicity
2. **Direct Processing**: No intermediate storage or complex workflows
3. **Flexible Prompts**: Maintained prompt customization for versatility
4. **Real-time Results**: Immediate display of comparison results
5. **Preserved Core Logic**: Kept existing text processing and comparison functions

## Active Issues
1. No progress indication during API calls
2. Basic error handling needs improvement
3. Strict text matching may be too rigid

## Next Steps
1. **Short Term**
   - Add loading indicators during processing
   - Improve error messages
   - Add basic retry logic for API failures

2. **Medium Term**
   - Implement automated tests
   - Add result history
   - Support batch processing

3. **Long Term**
   - Improve text comparison algorithms
   - Add configurable OCR settings
   - Support different comparison metrics
